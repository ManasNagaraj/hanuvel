  Adopt a structure and tempo that enables agility, innovation and creates resilience.
  
  There is little advantage in fast detection and authentic response to opportunities if the exploitation is stifled by well-meaning but self-limiting bureaucracy and structure. It is time to stop managing the probable and start leading the possible.
  
  Many of the systems we use in business are focused on control as opposed to innovation and empowerment.
  
  Hanuvel Strategic has developed and designed methods and techniques that can simplify organisational design, Human Resource management, Information Technology and digital systems. These reduce cost and increase tempo.
  
  Our consultants understand the theory that underpins all our work. Our methods deliberately challenge the systems dynamics approach.'

        Traditional management techniques focus on planning and problem solving, often the tools we use are designed to create certainty and predictability. These approaches have limited utility in a world that is inherently uncertain and unpredictable â€“ they are inauthentic.
        
        Successful companies are those who can let go of rigid management practices and embrace complexity. Successful leaders are those who can empower, guide and influence a network of employees, customers and suppliers.
